                  Elon Musk is a South African-born American entrepreneur and
                  businessman who founded X.com in 1999 (which later became
                  PayPal), SpaceX in 2002 and Tesla Motors in 2003. Musk became
                  a multimillionaire in his late 20s when he sold his start-up
                  company, Zip2, to a division of Compaq Computers. Musk made
                  headlines in May 2012, when SpaceX launched a rocket that
                  would send the first commercial vehicle to the International
                  Space Station. He bolstered his portfolio with the purchase of
                  SolarCity in 2016 and cemented his standing as a leader of
                  industry by taking on an advisory role in the early days of
                  President Donald Trump's administration. In January 2021, Musk
                  reportedly surpassed Jeff Bezos as the wealthiest man in the
                  world.

                  attend Queen's University, avoiding mandatory service in the
                  South African military. His plan was to go United States where
                  he thought great things are possible, more than any other
                  country. And it would be easy to get to the United States from

                  X.com merged with Confinity, which had a money-transfer
                  service called PayPal and Musk became the CEO and company's
                  largest shareholder by owning 11.7% of shares. The merged
                  company focused on the PayPal service and was later renamed
                  PayPal. PayPal's early growth was driven mainly by a viral
                  marketing campaign where new customers were recruited when
                  they received money through the service. Musk met his first
                  wife, Canadian author Justine Wilson, while both were students
                  at Ontario's Queen's University. They married in 2000. Their
                  first son, Nevada Alexander Musk, died of sudden infant death
                  syndrome (SIDS) at the age of 10 weeks.

                  Musk was ousted in October 2000 from his role as CEO of PayPal
                  (although he remained on the board) due to disagreements with
                  other company leadership, notably over his desire to move
                  PayPal's Unix-based infrastructure to Microsoft Windows.

                  crops growing on Martian regolith, in an attempt to regain

                  In October 2001, Musk travelled to Moscow with Jim Cantrell
                  (an aerospace supplies fixer), and Adeo Ressi (his best friend
                  from college), to buy refurbished Dnepr Intercontinental
                  ballistic missiles (ICBMs) that could send the envisioned
                  payloads into space. The group met with companies such as NPO
                  Lavochkin and Kosmotras; however, according to Cantrell, Musk
                  was seen as a novice and was consequently spat on by one of
                  the Russian chief designers, and the group returned to the
                  United States empty-handed.

                  In February 2002, the group returned to Russia to look for
                  three ICBMs, bringing along Mike Griffin. Griffin had worked
                  for the CIA's venture capital arm, In-Q-Tel, as well as NASA's
                  Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and was just leaving Orbital
                  Sciences, a maker of satellites and spacecraft. The group met
                  again with Kosmotras, and were offered one rocket for US$8
                  million; however, this was seen by Musk as too expensive; Musk
                  consequently stormed out of the meeting. On the flight back
                  from Moscow, Musk realized that he could start a company that
                  could build the affordable rockets he needed.

                  In 2008, Musk began dating English actress Talulah Riley, and
                  in 2010, the couple married. In January 2012, Musk announced
                  that he had ended his four-year relationship with Riley,
                  tweeting to Riley, "It was an amazing four years. I will love
                  you forever. You will make someone very happy one day." In
                  July 2013, Musk and Riley remarried. In December 2014, Musk
                  filed for a second divorce from Riley; however, the action was
                  withdrawn. The media announced in March 2016 that divorce
                  proceedings were again under way, this time with Riley filing
                  for divorce from Musk. The divorce was finalized in late 2016.

                  Musk was referenced by Dr. Martin Stein on The CW time-travel
                  TV show DC's Legends of Tomorrow. During time travel to the

                  Elon Musk, to disguise his own identity. By 2016, Musk's

                  In July 2018, Musk attempted to provide assistance to rescuers
                  during the Tham Luang cave rescue by ordering his employees to
                  build a small rescue pod. Thai authorities decided not to use
                  the submarine, describing it as technologically impressive but
                  impractical

                  In September 2018, Musk was charged by the U.S. Securities and
                  Exchange Commission for a tweet claiming that funding had been
                  secured for taking Tesla private. The lawsuit characterized
                  the tweet as false, misleading, and damaging to investors. As
                  a result, Musk and Tesla were fined $20 million each, and Musk
                  was forced to step down as Tesla chairman within 45 days while
                  remaining Tesla's CEO. Musk also proclaimed in several
                  interviews since that he does not regret sending the tweet
                  that triggered the SEC investigation. According to Reuters,
                  Musk said the tweet that cost him and the company $20 million
                  in fines was "Worth It".

                  In an interview with Joe Rogan in September 2018, Musk warned
                  about the dangers of developing artificial intelligence
                  indiscriminately.

                  In mid-September 2018, Musk appeared on The Joe Rogan
                  Experience podcast and discussed various topics for 21/2
                  hours. Within five days, the appearance had registered 10
                  million YouTube views. One of the highest profile and
                  controversial aspects of the program was Musk's puffing from a
                  cannabis-laced cigarette offered by Rogan. The Washington Post
                  observed, "In the media's hands, it became a story about
                  Musk's growing instability ..." Tesla stock dropped after the
                  incident, which coincided with the confirmation of the
                  departure of Tesla's Vice President of Worldwide Finance
                  earlier that day. Fortune wondered if the cannabis use could
                  have ramifications for SpaceX contracts with the United States
                  Air Force, though a USAF spokesperson told The Verge that
                  there was no investigation being carried out and that the Air
                  Force is still processing the situation.

                  In October 2018, in an effort to help solve the Flint water
                  crisis, Musk and the Musk Foundation donated over $480,000 to
                  install new water fountains with filtration systems for access
                  to clean water at all Flint, Michigan schools.

                  Musk first mentioned Teslaquila in an April Fools tweet in
                  2018. The proposed Tesla-branded tequila become closer to a
                  reality in October 2018 as Tesla filed an 'intent to use'
                  trademark application with the U.S. Patent and Trademark
                  Office. The trademark is for distilled agave liquor. Musk
                  reaffirmed his intention to release the product with a tweet,
                  featuring a mockup of the bottle, on October 12.

                  In January 2019, Musk traveled to China for the groundbreaking
                  of Tesla's Shanghai Gigafactory, which is the company's first
                  large-scale plant outside the U.S. Part of his visit to China,
                  Musk also met the Chinese premier Li Keqiang. During their
                  exchange, Musk confessed his love for China and wished he
                  could visit China more often, to which the Chinese premier was
                  quoted as saying "We can issue you a Chinese green card if
                  that helps."
